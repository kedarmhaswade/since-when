# The Great Java @Since Generator ...

## Introduction
Generates a report for all the methods for the JDK src.zip classes so that you know which method is since when.
In a way, this is just regex parsing with @since, but I wanted to try out the javaparser library :-).

## Instructions

JDK 8 and mvn are needed. And you also need the **src.zip** that comes with any JDK installation. Clone the repo and run the script sw.sh.
